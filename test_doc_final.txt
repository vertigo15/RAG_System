This is a comprehensive test document for the RAG system. It demonstrates the two-phase ingestion pipeline with document processor and chunking services. The document processor extracts text, generates summaries and Q&A pairs, then stores everything in MinIO. The chunking service then retrieves the content, applies appropriate chunking strategies, generates embeddings, and stores vectors in Qdrant. This end-to-end test validates the complete architecture redesign.
