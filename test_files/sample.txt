RAG System Test Document

This is a plain text file for testing the RAG system's ability to process TXT files.

Introduction
The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system is designed to index and search through various document types. This test file will verify that plain text files are properly processed.

Features
- Text extraction
- Paragraph detection
- Semantic chunking
- Vector embedding generation

Technical Details
Plain text files are the simplest format to process. They don't require OCR or complex layout analysis. The system should:
1. Read the file with UTF-8 encoding
2. Split content into paragraphs
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Store in Qdrant vector database

Multilingual Support
שלום! This text contains Hebrew.
مرحبا! This text contains Arabic.
Hello! This text contains English.

The language detection system should identify multiple languages within the same document.

Conclusion
If you can see this text in the RAG system after upload, the TXT file processing is working correctly!
